Please be sure before reporting a bug that it is not an issue with Entity Model/Texture Features, or Optifine. To do this, try the resource pack using both of them, and/or check my Modrinth changelogs for warnings about specific compatibility issues.

**Describe the bug.**
Please provide a clear and concise description of the bug! Screenshots are also appreciated!

**Provide the version of Minecraft you're using.**
I'll need to know which version you're using to inspect the bug myself. 

**If applicable, also tell me which mods you were using that the resource pack modifies, and their versions.**
Same as above.
