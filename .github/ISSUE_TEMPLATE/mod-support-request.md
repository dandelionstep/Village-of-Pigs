**Important: Mods that use mods that use alternative models for mobs, for example Guard Villagers, a lot of illager mods, etc. will not be prioritized due to technical limitations. I think at this point they're possible, so suggestions are allowed, but I can't guarantee they will be completed.**

**Name of & link to mod you would like me to add support for.**
